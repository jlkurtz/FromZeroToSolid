HTML
----------

### What I Did
I created a simple website, hosted on github at [https://jlkurtz.github.io/](https://jlkurtz.github.io/). It's very simple with a home page and a projects page. I didn't use any styling.

I took a first pass using an existing website, but I felt I was just blindly coping the content and styles.  Eventually I stripped the content down to almost nothing and removed all css. I'll save the CSS for the next project.



### Block Level Elements

A look at common block level HTML elements

* Header: 
* Navigation Bar
* Main Content
* Sidebar
* Footer

### Observations

A few notes

* `<head>`
  * `<meta>` elements
    * `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` - control viewports size and shape
    * `<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">` -  Version of Internet Explorer this should be rendered in

* The HTML5 structural elements are helpful for screen readers. More helpful than just using `div`'s.
